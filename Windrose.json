(Rise!)\nThe horns resound off the mountains\nUp from the fields of the battle\nWe raise our shields in a row\n\nDown where the flame is awakened\nFor the war the ground is shaking\nBeneath the soles of the warriors\nThey're rushing fast to the call\n\nFull force warriors! (Hu!)\nThe axes now are aiming\nStraight at the heart of the battle\nWe praise the crown with their blood\n\nH\u0435re all my brothers are standing\nTo fac\u0435 the ranks of the enemy\nShines on the stone of the mountain\nThe dwarves of iron and gold\n\nIn the fray, in the fire we are marching on\nTill the end, through the dark we are holding on\nFar from our home we're standing as one when the battlefield calls\nTogether we're marching on\nIn the fray, in the fire, we are marching on\nTill the end, we're still holding on\nTogether we fall, together we fight\nAnd once together we rise\nSee Wind Rose LiveGet tickets as low as $170You might also likeWe are the fire for the smithery\nWe are ready to burn\nWe are the cold of the winter night\nWe are blinded by the blood of our enemies\nAnd once together we rise\nWe are the fire for the smithery\nWe are ready to burn\nWe are the cold of the winter night\nWe are blinded by the blood of our enemies\nAnd once together we rise\n\nStrong is the blow of the hammers\nSmashing their lines overwhelmed\nBy steel ranks of dwarves in the frontline\nTo fight until they will fall\nWe don't look back or surrender\nCursed is the fate of contenders\nThe wrath of dwarves is upon them\nComing from the depths of the mountain halls\n\nRise with force\nThrough the fire you'll stand with us\nTales of war burn like flame on winter nights\nRise with force\nThrough this night you'll stand with us\nSide by side till the end we'll stand as one\nRise with force\nThrough the fire you'll stand with us\nTales of war burn like flame on winter nights\nRise with force\nThrough this night you'll stand with us\nSide by side till the end we'll stand as one\nIn the fray, in the fire, we are marching on\nTill the end, through the dark we are holding on\nFar from our home we're standing as one when the battlefield calls\nTogether we're marching on\nIn the fray, in the fire, we are marching on\nTill the end, we're still holding on\nTogether we fall, together we fight\nAnd once together we rise\n\nWe are the fire for the smithery\nWe are ready to burn\nWe are the cold of the winter night\nWe are blinded by the blood of our enemies\nAnd once together we rise\nWe are the fire for the smithery\nWe are ready to burn\nWe are the cold of the winter night\nWe are blinded by the blood of our enemies\nAnd once together we rise\n\nWe walk into the twilight\nWe walk into the twilight\nAnd once together we rise\nWe walk into the twilight\nWe walk into the twilight\nThe dwarves together will riseEmbed"
